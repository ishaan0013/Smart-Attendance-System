# Smart Attendance System

🚀 Welcome to my Smart Attendance System project! 🎓🔍

## Overview

This Python-based project leverages computer vision and neural networks to create a smart attendance system. It incorporates real-time face detection, recognition, and automated attendance logging.

## Tools and Techniques Used

- ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54) Core scripting and automation
- **OpenCV:** Webcam access and image processing
- **Dlib:** Face detection and recognition
- **Pandas:** Data management and CSV handling
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Interactive feedback
- **GitHub:** Version control and collaboration

## Features

- Real-time face detection from webcam
- Neural network-based face recognition
- Automated attendance logging in a CSV file
- Interactive feedback using Text-to-Speech

## Usage

1. Install dependencies: `pip install opencv-python pyttsx3 dlib numpy pandas`
2. Run Capturing File: `python capture_known_faces.py`
3. Run Main File: `python smart_attendance_system.py`
