# Smart Attendance System

üöÄ Welcome to my Smart Attendance System project! üéìüîç

## Overview

This Python-based project leverages computer vision and neural networks to create a smart attendance system. It incorporates real-time face detection, recognition, and automated attendance logging.

## Tools and Techniques Used

- ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54) Core scripting and automation
- ![OpenCV](https://img.shields.io/badge/opencv-%23white.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=opencv&logoColor=white) Webcam access and image processing
- ![NumPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/numpy-%23013243.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=numpy&logoColor=white) NumPy is used particularly in handling facial encodings and calculating Euclidean distances for face recognition in the project.
- ![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/pandas-%23150458.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=pandas&logoColor=white) Data management and CSV handling
- ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white) Version control and collaboration

## Features

- Real-time face detection from webcam
- Neural network-based face recognition
- Automated attendance logging in a CSV file
- Interactive feedback using Text-to-Speech

## Usage

1. Install dependencies: `pip install opencv-python pyttsx3 dlib numpy pandas`
2. Run Capturing File: `python capture_known_faces.py`
3. Run Main File: `python smart_attendance_system.py`

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork, open issues, and submit pull requests to enhance the system.



Feel free to explore the code, experiment, and contribute to make it even smarter! üåü
